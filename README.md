# Advent of Code 2018

This year I got through about 13 problems in the set. I had a lot of fun learning Mathematica and finding compact ways to solve these problems.

Things learned:
* Mathematica's has a built-in function for almost everything (e.g. see the three-line solution to Day 6 with [DistanceMatrix](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/DistanceMatrix.html) and [Nearest](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Nearest.html)).
* Python is faster for simple for-loops (e.g. see Day 9 and the attached Python solution).
