# Advent of Code 2018

This year I got through about 13 problems in the set. I had a lot of fun learning Mathematica and finding compact (and sometimes not) ways to solve problems. Mathematica is functional programming with training wheels and some problems would have been way easier to think about as objects.

Things learned:
* Mathematica's has a built-in function for almost everything (e.g. see the three-line solution to Day 6 with [DistanceMatrix](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/DistanceMatrix.html) and [Nearest](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Nearest.html)).
* Python can be faster for simple for-loops (e.g. see Day 9 and the attached Python solution).
* I was not strong enough to try to implement a linked-list in Mathematica.

My only regret is that Mathematica notebooks are not Github viewable. Write that in my epitaph.
